            Writing is what it’s all about! This site started as a blogging
            experiment and kinda took on a life of its own.

            This is a personal celebrity blog. So far, I have seen no need for
            an economic sponsorship of any kind. I didn’t start this as a
            commercial venture because it’s more of writing hobby of mine. At
            this moment I’d rather be free to write what I like when I can,
            rather than produce an article on schedule. I tend to like putting
            my own spin on stories, which is why every reporting here is biased.
            I know my personal brand of humor is a bit dry, which seems to fit
            my writing (I think). Yes, I take sides. I’m with the blond with the
            sparkly guitar who bakes cookies at night and calls it a party.

          I love Taylor Swift and The Agency. I found that news articles about
          Taylor seem to be either lost about the order of events or taking
          phrases out of context to make up news. You don’t need me to figure it
          out. But it’s nice to just see it on plain text once in a while. I
          also like writing a lot.

          I’ve tried to bring the actual blog entry
          more to the foreground. I will provide you with pictures and media as
          well as long as they pertain to the event (or just a lovely picture of
          Taylor that I found if there is none) but the story comes to the
          foreground rather than get lost amidst all the graphic art. As a blog,
          I feel entitled to give my own little spin to the story, so I will
          include inside jokes that only Taylor fans would know. Then again,
          sometimes my humor tends to fall flat as there are inside jokes
          pertaining to the blog itself.
